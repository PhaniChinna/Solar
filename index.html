          The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of
          the Milky Way galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound
          to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
          Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of
          moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in
          night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems
          orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found
          all the time. Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy
          are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one
          of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.

        <h2>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</h2>
        <p>
          There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with
          planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the
          "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for
          Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar."

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Sun is the largest object within our solar system, comprising
            99.8% of the system’s mass.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Sun is located at the center of our solar system, and Earth
            orbits 93 million miles away from it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though massive, the Sun still isn’t as large as other types of
            stars. It’s classified as a yellow dwarf star.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Sun's magnetic field spreads throughout the solar system via the
            solar wind.
